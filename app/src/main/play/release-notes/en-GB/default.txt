Warning!  
This release targets API level 30, which changes how Android lets Syncthing interact with the filesystem. As always please make sure you have a good backup of your data, and do look out for problems testing for betas, and any reports to https://forum.syncthing.net are much appreciated (also positive ones :) ).  
For more details, check out the issue linked below.

* Target API level 30 / Android 11 ( https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-android/issues/1721 )
