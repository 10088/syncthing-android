This release targets API level 30, which changes how Android lets Syncthing interact with the filesystem. As a consequence the db is reset, meaning everything gets scanned again which takes some time and battery power.

* Target API level 30 / Android 11 ( https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-android/issues/1721 )
* Update Syncthing to v1.19.0 ( https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/releases/tag/v1.19.0 )
